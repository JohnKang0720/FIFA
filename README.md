# ⚽ FIFA Statistical Inference Project

This repository contains a **statistical inference analysis** on FIFA player data using classical methods including:

- Two‑sample *t*‑tests  
- Bootstrapping  
- Central Limit Theorem (CLT) concepts  
- Confidence intervals and hypothesis testing

The full analysis is contained in the Jupyter Notebook:  
`STAT_201_Project_(FIFA).ipynb`

## 📌 Project Summary

This project explores statistical questions about FIFA player metrics and tests hypotheses using foundational inference techniques.  
Key objectives include:

- Performing **two‑sample *t*‑tests** between player groups  
- Applying **bootstrapping** to estimate sampling distributions  
- Demonstrating the **Central Limit Theorem**
- Reporting inference results with confidence intervals and *p‑values*

## 🧠 Methodology

### 🔹 Data Loading & Cleaning
The dataset is imported and cleaned to ensure valid comparisons between relevant player groups.

### 🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis
Visualizations and summary statistics help characterize the distributions being analyzed.

### 🔹 Hypothesis Testing
- **Two‑sample *t*‑tests** are used to compare population means  
- Null and alternative hypotheses are clearly stated
- *p*-values and effect sizes are interpreted

### 🔹 Bootstrapping
- Resampling techniques are used to approximate the sampling distribution of statistics.
- Confidence intervals are computed using bootstrap samples.

### 🔹 Central Limit Theorem (CLT)
- Demonstrates how sample means approximate normality even with non‑normal data.
- Visualizations show sampling distributions for various sample sizes.

## Future Extensions

- Bayesian inference comparisons
- Effect size computations (e.g., Cohen’s d)
- Non‑parametric tests (e.g., Mann–Whitney U)
- Interactive dashboards for inference exploration
